## Difference between syntactical analysis vs semantical analysis in terms of ML

Syntactic Analysis : Syntactic Analysis of a sentence is the task of recognising a sentence and assigning a syntactic structure to it. These syntactic structures are assigned by the Context Free Grammar (mostly PCFG) using parsing algorithms like Cocke-Kasami-Younger (CKY), Earley algorithm, Chart Parser. They are represented in a tree structure. These parse trees serve an important intermediate stage of representation for semantic analysis.

Semantic Analysis : Intermediate meaning representations are composed for linguistic expressions. Mostly meaning representations are assigned to sentences solely on the basis of knowledge gained from the lexicon and the grammar, this approach is referred as syntax-driven semantic analysis. First Order Logic can also be used to represent a sentence in a language.
